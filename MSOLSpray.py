This is a pure Python rewrite of dafthack's MSOLSpray (https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray/) which is written in PowerShell. All credit goes to him!

This script will perform password spraying against Microsoft Online accounts (Azure/O365). The script logs if a user cred is valid, if MFA is enabled on the account, if a tenant doesn't exist, if a user doesn't exist, if the account is locked, or if the account is disabled.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
This command will use the provided userlist and attempt to authenticate to each account with a password of Winter2020.
    python3 MSOLSpray.py --userlist ./userlist.txt --password Winter2020

This command uses the specified FireProx URL to spray from randomized IP addresses and writes the output to a file. See this for FireProx setup: https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox.
    python3 MSOLSpray.py --userlist ./userlist.txt --password P@ssword --url https://api-gateway-endpoint-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/fireprox --out valid-users.txt
